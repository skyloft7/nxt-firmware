# Forked by skyloft7 from dlech/nxt-firmware

I keep this repo around because I still own a Lego Mindstorms NXT 2.0 (in 2022, yeah!) and wanna
tinker with it's firmware every once in a while. Hopefully one day I'll get an EV3 or Robot Inventor :)


# This is the original readme content

This is NXT Improved Firmware, an open source community driven work based on
the original LEGO Mindstorms NXT firmware.

Online resources are accessible on the NXT Improved Firmware web page,
including documentation, building guides, and more:
